# 🎮 Donkey Kong Game - Unity Project

This is a 2D recreation of the **classic Donkey Kong arcade game**, originally released by Nintendo in **1981*, which I developed using **Unity** and **C#**. This project captures the core gameplay mechanics of the original — including platform climbing, obstacle avoidance, and level progression — while applying modern game development practices such as physics simulation, scripting, and modular design. Built as part of an academic micro-project, it serves both as a nostalgic tribute and a learning milestone in 2D game development.
